# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
 Using Microsoft Excel for Data Analysis and Visualisation for the kickstarter campaign project.

## Purpose
 This is the project to help an upcoming playwriter, Louise to fund her play. With the help of fundraising data all across the globe, we will determine what are the specific factors that make the campaign successful. We will import the data and perform Excel analysis on it and visualize it and interprete common visualizations.

## Analysis and Challenges
 We imported a large kickstarter data for the analysis. Applied different filters. Done conditional formatting and applied different formulae. Then generated different pivot tables and interpreted pivot tables with the help of graphs. Applied different statistical formulae  and identified outliers in the datasets.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 From the chart for "outcomes based on launch date", we can deduct that May is the best month for launching a fundraiser campaign for Louise. Next best months are June and July. So summer is the best season to kickstart Louise's campaign. Between April to September, there is high chance for Louise to raise her goal.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
First of all, not a single campaign was 100% successful to raise the money. Goal amounts are way higher than pledged amounts most of the times.Outcomes based on goals chart gave us clear picture of successful campaigns. When the goal amount is smaller than $1000, outcome is highest. From the chart, we can conclude that Louise has to keep her goal amount below $4999 to make her campaign successful.

## Challenges and Difficulties
This data is from 2009 to 2017 so if Louise has to launch her campaign now, we don't know how relevant the conclusions are.
But if we ignore this fact, we faced the challenge due to large data from all across the globe. Original data given has to be formatted according to our needs to analyse it.I personally faced difficulties while implementing Excel functions like VLOOKUP(),COUNTIFS().

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

    Successful campaigns are launch in summer and May is the best month for it.
All the successful campaigns are short in duration.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

    If the goal to raise the money is less than $5000 then chance of successful campaign is higher.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    
    Dataset is old, kickstarter campaigns are done through internet so the people who don't have internet access don't know about it, 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

    We could create duration of the campaign graph.
